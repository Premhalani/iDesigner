This is a VR Android application that was built using Unity3D and can be used with VR headsets like Google Carboard. Using the application, users can redesign their home without having to pay a professional decorator. They can mix and match colors and furniture in an immersive way using VR headset. 

Right now it has a predefined house format, but later users can create their own house structure and play with it.
